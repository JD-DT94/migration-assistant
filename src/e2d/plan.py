"""Deployment sequencing: turn a MigrationSummary into an ordered rollout plan.

Two jobs:

1. **Order.** Converted artifacts depend on each other — routing/retention
   decide where data lands, pipelines create the custom fields dashboards
   query, and detectors need data flowing before they can evaluate — so the
   plan lists the steps in the order that avoids dead ends.
2. **Field gaps.** Cross-reference the custom fields each converted dashboard
   queries against the fields the converted pipelines actually produce. A
   field nobody produces is the #1 cause of a tile that renders empty with no
   error, so it is called out per dashboard before anything is deployed.
