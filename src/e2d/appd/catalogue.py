"""The AppDynamics -> Dynatrace configuration catalogue.

Every kind of thing an AppDynamics estate holds, what it becomes in Dynatrace,
and — the part that decides how big the project really is — whether it needs
migrating at all.

A large share of an AppD configuration exists only because AppD requires manual
setup for things Dynatrace derives automatically: service detection, dependency
mapping, baselining, snapshot capture. Those items are marked `NOT_NEEDED`, and
counting them honestly is usually the difference between a migration that looks
impossible and one that fits the window. Treating the estate as a 1:1 port is
the single most expensive mistake available.

The catalogue drives two outputs: the coverage report (what your export
contains, against everything that exists) and the phased sequencing guide.
