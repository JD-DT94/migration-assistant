# migration assist (`e2d`)

Convert **Elastic / Kibana** and **AppDynamics** artifacts into Dynatrace
equivalents. **The primary export is a Terraform child module** (`terraform/`)
you can drop into an existing repo or apply via `terraform/example-root/`.
JSON, Markdown guides, and optional live push are supporting paths.

## Use it in the browser (nothing to install)

Drag an export onto the page, click **Convert**, download the results.
Everything runs inside your browser tab (Python compiled to WebAssembly) —
your files are never uploaded anywhere.

## What converts

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Kibana dashboard exports (`.ndjson`) — Lens (incl. formulas), TSVB, legacy visualizations, saved searches, controls, Vega with embedded ES queries | Dynatrace dashboard JSON **and** `dynatrace_document` Terraform |
| Watchers and Kibana alerting rules | Davis anomaly detectors + Workflows (Terraform) |
| Logstash `.conf` and Elasticsearch ingest pipelines | OpenPipeline DQL/DPL stages + Terraform |
| ES\|QL, Query DSL, KQL, Lucene | DQL |
| Continuous transforms | Rollup DQL |
| Kibana SLOs (custom-KQL indicators) | Grail `makeTimeseries` SLI + `dynatrace_platform_slo` Terraform |
| Filebeat configs (`filebeat.yml`) | OpenTelemetry Collector configs shipping to Dynatrace |
| Heartbeat monitors (`heartbeat.yml`) | Dynatrace Synthetic HTTP monitor definitions |
| ILM policies, index templates, enrich policies | Migration guides (bucket retention, routing, lookups) + `CUTOVER-PLAN.md` |

### AppDynamics

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Application / tier / node inventory (`/controller/rest/applications/{app}/nodes`) | `ONBOARDING-PLAN.md` — OneAgent rollout waves sized by **host**, host-group and tagging design, `waves.json` + `host_groups.json` |
| Health rules (`/controller/alerting/rest/v1/.../health-rules`) | Davis anomaly detectors (Settings JSON or Terraform), with AppD units rescaled |
| Custom dashboards (`CustomDashboardImportExportServlet`) | Dynatrace dashboard JSON **and** `dynatrace_document` Terraform |
| Policies and actions (`/controller/policies`, `/controller/actions`) | Notification plan (problem notifications / Workflow tasks) |
| Information points, data collectors, transaction detection rules | Inventory + guidance (business events, request attributes, custom services) |
| *(always)* | `APPD-SEQUENCING.md` — ten-phase running order with per-wave exit criteria |
| *(always)* | `APPD-CATALOGUE.md` — every AppD config type vs its Dynatrace equivalent, including what needs no migration |

The catalogue is the part worth reading first. It classifies every AppD config
type as **converted automatically**, **guided** (plan generated, you apply it),
**rebuild by hand**, or **nothing to migrate** — that last group being
configuration that exists only because AppD needs manual setup for things
Dynatrace derives automatically (service detection, dependency mapping,
baselining, snapshot capture). Confirming which of those you hold is usually
the cheapest scope reduction available, and treating the estate as a 1:1 port
is the most expensive mistake.

Three AppD-specific behaviours worth knowing, because they are where a naive
converter goes silently wrong:

- **Units are rescaled.** AppD reports response time in milliseconds; the Grail
  metric `dt.service.request.response_time` is in microseconds. A 2000 ms
  threshold becomes 2000000, and the conversion is stated in the report.
- **Baseline health rules become auto-adaptive detectors, or nothing at all.**
  A rule comparing against an AppD baseline has no static threshold to carry
  across. Where Dynatrace baselines the metric natively (service response time,
  failure rate, host saturation) the rule is reported as covered out of the box
  — recreating it would duplicate coverage. For any other resolvable metric it
  converts to an **auto-adaptive** Davis detector (the AppD deviation count maps
  to `numberOfSignalFluctuations`). Pass `--baseline-detectors` to convert even
  the covered ones when you need a custom scope, window or severity.
- **Nothing is entity-scoped automatically.** AppD scopes by application/tier/BT
  name and there is no reliable offline mapping to Dynatrace entities. Converted
  detectors and tiles carry their original AppD scope as a note for a human to
  apply, rather than a guessed filter that would match nothing.

Every run also produces a plain-English `MIGRATION_REPORT.md` with a
deployment-order plan, per-dashboard field manifests (`*.fields.md`
— what must exist at ingest or a tile renders empty), a `METRICS-GUIDE.md`
with log→metric extraction best practice, a `CUTOVER-PLAN.md` dual-ship
schedule when ILM policies are present, and a suggested mapping config when
index patterns need rules.

## Terraform export

The primary deliverable is **one child module**. `e2d migrate … -o out/` writes
it at `out/terraform/`. `e2d web` does the same under the current directory:

```
sources/              # inbox — uploads accumulate
out/terraform/        # THE exportable repo, rebuilt on every Convert
.e2d/                 # tokens + download zips (gitignored)
```

Each Convert rebuilds the module from **everything in the inbox**. We do not
merge HCL across independent runs (that would orphan or duplicate resources).

```
out/terraform/
  versions.tf              # required_providers only — no provider block
  variables.tf             # name_prefix, detectors_enabled=false
  dashboards.tf            # dynatrace_document + documents/*.json
  detectors.tf
  pipelines.tf
  workflows.tf
  request_attributes.tf
  slos.tf                  # dynatrace_platform_slo (custom DQL SLI)
  maintenance.tf           # AppD schedules
  outputs.tf
  example-root/main.tf     # standalone apply entry
  README.md
```

**Take it with you** (the tool never `git push`es):

1. Copy `out/terraform/` into an existing repo and call `module "migrated" { source = "…" }`.
2. Or `cd out/terraform/example-root && terraform init && terraform plan`.
3. Or `cd out/terraform && git init && git add . && git commit` and push to *your* remote.
4. Or download `terraform-module.zip` from the GUI.

Detectors stay disabled until you set `detectors_enabled = true` per wave.

## CLI

```bash
pip install -e .            # Python >= 3.9, stdlib only
e2d assess <export-dir>                     # scorecard only, converts nothing
                                            # exit 0 clean / 2 manual work / 1 errors
e2d migrate <export-dir> -o out/            # convert everything, one Terraform module
ls out/terraform/                           # child module: copy, zip, or git init
e2d web                                     # local GUI; sources/ accumulates, out/terraform/ rebuilds
e2d dashboard export.ndjson -o out/         # dashboards only
e2d verify out/ --env-url https://<env>.apps.dynatrace.com          # DQL check
e2d verify out/ --data ...                  # + flag tiles that return no data
e2d push out/dashboards --env-url ... --apply                       # deploy
e2d parity out/ --es-url https://es:9200 --index logs-*             # dual-ship count check
e2d backfill --es-url ... --index logs-* --from 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z \
             --to 2026-02-01T00:00:00Z --apply    # history past the 24h ingest wall
e2d web                                     # local GUI
```

Dynatrace rejects log records older than 24 hours, so history cannot be
replayed as-is. `e2d backfill` re-stamps records into the accepted window and
keeps the true event time in an `original_timestamp` attribute; query it with
`fetch logs | filter backfilled == "true" and original_timestamp >= "..."`.
Use `e2d backfill --es-url ... --discover` to list indices with doc counts and
time ranges, pass a comma-separated `--index` list to move several in one run,
or do the whole thing point-and-click in the local GUI (`e2d web`): the
"Backfill historical logs" panel discovers indices, dry-runs with a sample
record, ships with live progress, and verifies the landed counts in Grail.

Backfill is resilient by default: every send retries with exponential backoff
(429/5xx honor Retry-After; the defaults mirror the OpenTelemetry Collector's),
progress is checkpointed per index so an interrupted run resumes instead of
duplicating, permanently rejected batches land in a dead-letter file you can
re-send with `--redrive`, and each record carries a deterministic `dedup.key`
so any duplicates stay detectable in DQL. Every run also writes
`migration_report.json` (scorecard, per-item outcomes, plan) for CI and
tooling.

Translated field references are lowercased automatically (Dynatrace
normalizes log attribute keys to lowercase at ingest, so `audit.logText`
lands as `audit.logtext`); disable with `"lowercase_fields": false` or
override per field with an explicit rename.

Use a `mapping.config.json` to route index patterns to data objects and
rename fields — see `samples/mapping.config.json`. Drop it in with your
export and it is applied automatically.

## Samples

`samples/` contains synthetic simple and complex examples of every artifact
type — see `samples/README.md`. Try:

```bash
e2d migrate samples -o out/
```

## Development

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest tests
```

Tests run in CI before every deploy of the hosted page. Never commit real
Elastic exports — `.gitignore` keeps `examples/` and private data out.
