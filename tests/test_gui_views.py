"""Platform tabs in both GUIs: home, Elastic, AppDynamics.

The two pages are large inline blobs with no build step, so a typo in a view
class silently hides a panel forever. These tests pin the wiring: the switch
attribute, one section per platform, and the invariant that the tab only
changes what is on screen — the converter itself is shared and never gated.
